# Building Awesome APIs  

I've recently delivered two talks on *API design best practices for libraries*. First at [ACCU 2025](https://accuconference.org/2025/session/awesome-api-design) and then again in the [Stockholm C++ Meetup](https://www.swedencpp.se/). It's a fun topic and even if the presentations start out the same way they soon diverge both in style and contents.

Here is a recording from the Stockholm C++ Meetup on May 8th. This is a longer version of the talk with a lot of interaction and participation from the audience.

The ACCU presentation from Apr 3rd is a more structured 20min conference talk, but it's not yet available online. I'll update the blog when it's up on YouTube.
