# Welcome to the Ivory Tower Blog

/// html | div[style='float: left; width: 75%']
I'm Anders Sundman, and the Ivory Tower blog is a collection of my musings on technology and software engineering. In this space, I share reflections on how we conjure things into existence using code, from a technical, social, and philosophical perspective.

I've been writing code for 30+ years, and I'm starting to get the hang of it. Throughout my career, I've been working with systems programming. Currently, I'm building eye-tracking software as a principal architect and tech lead at Tobii. My experience is mostly from working in the embedded space with signal processing and microcontrollers. But I've also built distributed backend systems and desktop applications.

For the past 20+ years, my native languages have been Python and C++. I got started with Turbo Pascal and then spent many years with Java and C#. Currently, I'm head over heels in love with Rust.
